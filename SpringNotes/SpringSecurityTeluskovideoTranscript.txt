### Hardcoding Username and Password in Spring Security
To begin, the goal is to configure Spring Security to authenticate multiple users without relying on the default username and password defined in the application properties. Instead of using the default configuration, the username and password will be hardcoded directly in the code. Spring Security typically uses a `UserDetailsService` to retrieve user credentials, which by default checks the application properties for a username and password. However, to customize this behavior, a custom `UserDetailsService` will be defined. This is achieved by creating a method named `userDetailsService()`, annotated with `@Bean`, which returns a `UserDetailsService` object. By defining this bean, Spring Security will use the data returned from this method to authenticate users, overriding any credentials specified in the application properties.

### Defining a Custom UserDetailsService
The `UserDetailsService` is an interface with a key method, `loadUserByUsername`, which returns a `UserDetails` object. Instead of implementing a custom class for `UserDetailsService`, the built-in `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` class is used. This class implements `UserDetailsManager`, which extends `UserDetailsService`, making it suitable for returning a `UserDetailsService` object. The `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` allows for specifying user credentials in memory, which is ideal for hardcoding usernames and passwords. To test this setup, the application is restarted manually, as hot reloading may not reliably apply changes. Upon accessing `localhost:8080` in an incognito browser window, the default credentials from the application properties (e.g., username: `list`, password: `1234`) are no longer accepted, confirming that the custom `UserDetailsService` is in effect.

### Specifying Hardcoded Users
To populate the `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` with user data, user credentials are specified using its constructor, which accepts a collection or variable-length arguments of `UserDetails` objects. To create a `UserDetails` object, the `User` class from Spring Security is used, which implements the `UserDetails` interface. The `User` class provides a `UserBuilder` through the `User.builder()` method, allowing configuration of user properties. For example, a user named `Naveen` is created with the password `n@123` and the role `USER`. The `withDefaultPasswordEncoder()` method is used for simplicity, though it is deprecated and not recommended for production due to its lack of secure password encoding. The builder pattern is applied for readability, with each method call (e.g., `.username()`, `.password()`, `.roles()`) on a new line, culminating in `.build()` to create the `UserDetails` object. This object is then passed to the `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` constructor.

### Adding Multiple Users
Multiple users can be added by creating additional `UserDetails` objects and passing them to the `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` constructor. For instance, a second user named `admin` is created with the password `admin@789` and the role `ADMIN`. Each user is configured similarly using `User.builder()`, with the default password encoder, username, password, and role specified. The application is restarted to ensure the changes take effect, and testing in an incognito browser confirms that the hardcoded credentials work. For example, logging in with `Naveen` and `n@123` or `admin` and `admin@789` succeeds, while incorrect credentials fail. This demonstrates that the custom `UserDetailsService` successfully overrides the default configuration and authenticates users based on the hardcoded data.

### Transitioning to Database-Driven Authentication
While hardcoding credentials is useful for testing, the ultimate goal is to authenticate users using data from a database. To achieve this, the default `UserDetailsService` provided by Spring Security will be replaced with a custom authentication provider that connects to a database. This requires creating a bean that returns an `AuthenticationProvider` object, named `authProvider()`, and annotated with `@Bean`. The `AuthenticationProvider` interface defines an `authenticate` method, which processes authentication requests and returns an `Authentication` object if successful or throws an exception if authentication fails. Since the application will interact with a database, the `DaoAuthenticationProvider` class is used, as it extends `AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider` and implements `AuthenticationProvider`.

### Configuring the DaoAuthenticationProvider
The `DaoAuthenticationProvider` requires configuration to connect to the database. Specifically, it needs a `UserDetailsService` to retrieve user data and a password encoder to handle password verification. Initially, the hardcoded `UserDetailsService` (using `InMemoryUserDetailsManager`) is commented out, as it relies on static values. A new `UserDetailsService` will be implemented to fetch user data from the database. The `DaoAuthenticationProvider` is configured by setting the `UserDetailsService` using the `setUserDetailsService` method and specifying a password encoder with `setPasswordEncoder`. For simplicity, the `NoOpPasswordEncoder` is used, which does not encode passwords, though this is not recommended for production. The `UserDetailsService` is autowired into the configuration, requiring Spring to provide an implementation.

### Implementing a Custom UserDetailsService
To fetch user data from the database, a custom `UserDetailsService` is created in a new class named `MyUserDetailsService`, placed in a `service` package for organizational clarity. This class is annotated with `@Service` and implements the `UserDetailsService` interface, requiring the implementation of the `loadUserByUsername` method. This method takes a username as input, queries the database, and returns a `UserDetails` object. To interact with the database, a repository interface named `UserRepo` is defined, which will be autowired into `MyUserDetailsService`. The `loadUserByUsername` method uses `UserRepo` to query the database for a user by username. If the user is found, a `UserDetails` object is returned; otherwise, a `UsernameNotFoundException` is thrown with a message indicating the user was not found.

### Creating the UserRepo Interface
Since the application uses Spring Data JPA, the `UserRepo` is defined as an interface extending `JpaRepository`. This interface requires two parameters: the entity class (`User`) representing the database table and the type of the primary key (`Integer`). The `User` class, representing the `users` table, is created in the `model` package with fields for `id`, `username`, and `password`, annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table(name = "users")` to map to the database table. Lombok’s `@Data` annotation is used to generate getters, setters, and other boilerplate code. The `id` field is annotated with `@Id` to mark it as the primary key. In `UserRepo`, a method `findByUsername(String username)` is defined to query the database for a user by username. To ensure uniqueness, the `username` field should ideally be marked as unique in the database schema, though the current design uses `id` as the primary key.

### Handling User Data and Exceptions
In the `loadUserByUsername` method of `MyUserDetailsService`, the `UserRepo` is used to call `findByUsername(username)`. The result, a `User` object, is checked for null. If null, a `UsernameNotFoundException` is thrown, indicating the user was not found. If a user is found, the method must return a `UserDetails` object. Since `User` is a custom entity and not a `UserDetails` implementation, a new class is needed to bridge this gap. This is addressed by creating a `UserPrincipal` class that implements `UserDetails` and wraps the `User` entity, allowing the application to return the required `UserDetails` object.

### Implementing UserPrincipal for UserDetails
The `UserPrincipal` class is created in the `model` package and implements the `UserDetails` interface, which requires several methods: `getAuthorities`, `getPassword`, `getUsername`, `isAccountNonExpired`, `isAccountNonLocked`, `isCredentialsNonExpired`, and `isEnabled`. For simplicity, the account status methods (`isAccountNonExpired`, etc.) are hardcoded to return `true`, assuming all accounts are active and valid. The `getUsername` and `getPassword` methods retrieve the respective values from the `User` object, which is passed to `UserPrincipal` via a constructor. The `getAuthorities` method returns a collection of `GrantedAuthority` objects, representing the user’s roles. Since the `User` entity does not currently include a roles field, a hardcoded role (`USER`) is assigned using `Collections.singleton(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("USER"))`. In a production system, roles should be stored in the database and retrieved dynamically.

### Integrating UserPrincipal with UserDetailsService
In the `loadUserByUsername` method, instead of returning the `User` object directly, a new `UserPrincipal` is created, passing the `User` object to its constructor. This ensures the method returns a `UserDetails` object, as required by the `UserDetailsService` interface. The `UserPrincipal` constructor assigns the `User` object to a field, allowing access to its properties in the `UserDetails` methods. This integration completes the authentication flow: the `DaoAuthenticationProvider` uses the custom `UserDetailsService` to load a `UserPrincipal`, which provides the necessary user details for authentication.

### Testing the Database-Driven Authentication
After implementing all components, the application is restarted to ensure changes are applied. Testing is performed in an incognito browser by accessing `localhost:8080`. Credentials from the database are used, such as username `naveen` with password `n@789` and username `hirsch` with password `h@123`. Successful logins confirm that the application is correctly querying the database and authenticating users. Entering incorrect credentials or a non-existent username results in a failure, with the `UsernameNotFoundException` being thrown for invalid usernames, as evidenced by a 404-like error message. This validates the end-to-end functionality of the custom authentication provider, `UserDetailsService`, and `UserPrincipal`.

### Organizing the Project Structure
To maintain a clean project structure, related classes are organized into packages. Controllers (`HelloController`, `StudentController`) are moved to a `controllers` package, the `User` and `Student` entities to a `model` package, the `MyUserDetailsService` to a `service` package, and the `UserRepo` to a `dao` package. This organization improves maintainability and clarity, ensuring each component has a logical place within the project.

### Future Considerations and Best Practices
The current implementation uses `NoOpPasswordEncoder` and `withDefaultPasswordEncoder`, which are insecure and deprecated, suitable only for learning purposes. In production, a secure password encoder like `BCryptPasswordEncoder` should be used. Additionally, the `User` entity could be enhanced with a `roles` field to store user authorities in the database, eliminating hardcoded roles in `UserPrincipal`. Features like account expiration, locking, or credential expiration can be implemented by modifying the `UserPrincipal` methods to check relevant fields in the `User` entity. The next steps involve reviewing the entire project flow to solidify understanding and exploring advanced Spring Security features.

### Project Summary: Understanding the Authentication Flow
The project aims to authenticate users by retrieving their credentials from a PostgreSQL database, specifically from a table named `users` with columns for `id`, `username`, and `password`. To achieve this, the default authentication mechanism in Spring Security is modified by implementing a custom authentication provider. The `DaoAuthenticationProvider` is used, as it facilitates database access for authentication. This provider requires a `UserDetailsService` to fetch user data, which is implemented in a class named `MyUserDetailsService`. This class implements the `UserDetailsService` interface, providing the `loadUserByUsername` method to retrieve user data. Since the data comes from a database, a repository layer, `UserRepo`, is created, extending `JpaRepository` to query the database using a `findByUsername` method. If a user is found, their details are returned; otherwise, a `UsernameNotFoundException` is thrown. To comply with Spring Security’s requirements, the `User` entity is wrapped in a `UserPrincipal` class, which implements the `UserDetails` interface. The `UserPrincipal` represents the current user (principal) and provides methods for retrieving the username, password, and authorities, as well as account status checks (e.g., expiration, locking), though these are currently hardcoded to `true`. The `User` entity, annotated as an `@Entity`, maps to the `users` table, with properties corresponding to the table’s columns. Additional configurations include specifying PostgreSQL connection details in the `application.properties` file and enabling JPA and `Data JPA` dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. While the application is secured, passwords are stored in plain text, which is insecure and requires improvement.

### Introduction to Bcrypt for Password Security
The project successfully stores and validates user credentials in the database using Spring Security, with minimal logic files (`HelloController` and `StudentController`) compared to configuration files for security. In a larger application, logic files would dominate, but configuration files remain limited. However, a significant issue is that passwords are stored and transmitted in plain text, posing a security risk. To address this, cryptography is introduced, specifically focusing on encryption and hashing. Encryption involves encoding a password with a key and decrypting it for verification, but this is vulnerable if the key is compromised. Hashing, a one-way process, is preferred, as it generates a unique hash for each input without the possibility of reverse-engineering the original password. When a user enters a password, it is hashed and compared to the stored hash. Common hashing algorithms include MD5 and SHA-256, but for enhanced security, multiple hashing rounds are desirable. Bcrypt is introduced as a robust algorithm that performs hashing over multiple rounds (e.g., 2^10 or 2^12 rounds), making it computationally intensive and resistant to brute-force attacks. To demonstrate, a Bcrypt password generator website is used, where a password like `h@123` is encoded with 10 or 12 rounds, producing a string starting with `$2a` (indicating the Bcrypt version) and `$10` or `$12` (indicating the number of rounds). This encoded format ensures passwords are secure even if the database is compromised.

### Implementing User Registration
To enable user registration, a new `UserController` is created in the `controllers` package, annotated as `@RestController`. This controller defines a `POST` endpoint at `/register`, which accepts a `User` object via a `@RequestBody` and returns the created user. The `User` entity is used to represent the user data. To handle the registration logic, a `UserService` class is created in the `service` package, annotated with `@Service`. This class includes a `saveUser` method that accepts a `User` object and saves it to the database using the existing `UserRepo`, which is autowired and provides a `save` method. The `UserController` autowires the `UserService` and calls `saveUser` to persist the user data. The application is tested using Postman, with an HTTP `POST` request to `/register`, including headers for authorization (using an existing user, e.g., `hirsch` with password `h@123`). A new user (e.g., `naveen`, password `n@35345`) is sent in the request body. Initially, a wrong authorization password is tested, resulting in a 401 error, but the correct password yields a 200 response with the stored user data. The database is queried to confirm the new user’s presence, validating the registration process. Bcrypt encoding is not yet implemented but will be addressed next.

### Implementing Bcrypt Encoding for User Registration
To secure user passwords during registration, Bcrypt encoding is implemented in the `UserService`. Before saving a user, the plain-text password is encoded using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`, which is part of Spring Security, requiring no additional dependencies. In the `saveUser` method, a `BCryptPasswordEncoder` is instantiated with a strength of 12 (matching the 2^12 rounds used in earlier examples). The user’s plain-text password is retrieved using `user.getPassword()`, encoded with `encoder.encode()`, and set back to the user object using `user.setPassword()`. For debugging, the encoded password is printed to the console, though this is not recommended in production. The registration process is tested again in Postman, creating a new user (e.g., `avni`, password `a@123`). The request succeeds, and the encoded password is visible in the console and database, confirming that the password is stored in Bcrypt format. However, authentication still uses plain-text passwords, as the `DaoAuthenticationProvider` is configured with `NoOpPasswordEncoder`, which must be updated to support Bcrypt.

### Configuring Bcrypt for Authentication
To enable Bcrypt-based authentication, the `SecurityConfig` is updated, specifically the `DaoAuthenticationProvider` configuration. Previously, the provider used `NoOpPasswordEncoder`, which allowed plain-text password comparisons. This is replaced with `new BCryptPasswordEncoder(12)` to ensure passwords are verified using Bcrypt with 12 rounds, matching the encoding strength used during registration. No other changes are required, as the existing `UserDetailsService` and `UserPrincipal` already handle user retrieval and validation. The application is restarted, and authentication is tested in Postman by sending a request to the `/hello` endpoint. Using a plain-text password user (e.g., `hirsch`, `h@123`) fails, as the database stores plain-text passwords incompatible with Bcrypt. However, using a Bcrypt-encoded user (e.g., `avni`, `a@123`) succeeds, confirming that Bcrypt authentication works. To fully transition, plain-text password records (e.g., `hirsch`) are removed, and only Bcrypt-encoded records (e.g., `avni`, `naveen`) are retained. The database is updated manually using an SQL `UPDATE` query to encode existing passwords (e.g., `n@35345` for `naveen`) with Bcrypt, ensuring consistency.

### Key Considerations and Best Practices
The implementation demonstrates a secure approach to password storage and authentication using Bcrypt. The `UserController` remains unaware of encoding, as the `UserService` handles password encoding, maintaining separation of concerns. The `DaoAuthenticationProvider` uses the same Bcrypt strength (12 rounds) for both registration and authentication to ensure compatibility. Using different strengths (e.g., 10 rounds for encoding, 12 for verification) would cause authentication failures. While the project is now more secure, further enhancements could include dynamic role management, account status checks, and additional security measures like HTTPS for data transmission. The configuration files, though numerous, are limited compared to potential logic files in a larger application, making the setup scalable and maintainable.
