### Introduction to JWT

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an open industry standard (RFC 7519) designed for securely transferring data between parties, primarily used for authentication and authorization in web applications. A JWT consists of three components: a Header, which specifies the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC-SHA256); a Payload, containing claims such as the subject (user identifier), issuance time (iat), and expiration time (exp); and a Signature, which ensures the token’s integrity by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret key. These components are Base64-encoded and concatenated with dots (.), forming a compact, URL-safe string. JWTs enable stateless authentication, eliminating the need for server-side session storage. When a client logs in, the server verifies credentials, generates a JWT, and sends it to the client. The client stores the token (e.g., in local storage) and includes it in the Authorization header (as a Bearer token) for subsequent requests. The server validates the token’s signature and claims, granting access to protected resources if valid.

### Cryptography in JWT

Cryptography is fundamental to securing data transmitted over the internet, where intermediaries could intercept or modify information, leading to attacks like man-in-the-middle (MITM). For example, if Person A sends a message to Person B to meet at 5 p.m., an attacker (Person C) could alter it to 6 p.m., performing an active attack. Cryptography prevents such attacks by ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext using a key, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties. Decryption reverses this process, converting ciphertext back to plaintext with the appropriate key. In the example, Person A encrypts the message, and only Person B, with the correct key, can decrypt and read it. Cryptography uses two main approaches: symmetric and asymmetric.

---

### Symmetric Key Cryptography

Symmetric key cryptography uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, shared between the sender and receiver. For instance, Person A encrypts a message with a key, and Person B uses the same key to decrypt it. This method is fast and supports large key sizes, enhancing security. However, key sharing poses a challenge, as it must occur securely (e.g., in person) to prevent interception. Additionally, in a network with multiple parties (e.g., A, B, D, E), each pair requires a unique key, complicating key management. Algorithms like AES and DES are commonly used for symmetric cryptography, each with specific strengths and weaknesses.

---

### Asymmetric Key Cryptography

Asymmetric key cryptography addresses the key-sharing problem by using a pair of keys: a public key, known to everyone, and a private key, known only to the owner. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. For example, if Person A wants to send a message to Person B, A encrypts it with B’s public key, and only B can decrypt it with their private key. This ensures confidentiality, as only the intended recipient can access the message. Asymmetric cryptography is slower than symmetric but simplifies key distribution, as public keys can be shared openly. Common algorithms include RSA and ECC, with varying performance and security characteristics.

---

### Digital Signatures

While encryption ensures confidentiality, it does not verify the sender’s identity. For instance, Person C could intercept and modify Person A’s message to Person B, encrypting it with B’s public key, making it appear legitimate. Digital signatures address this by proving the sender’s identity. Person A encrypts the message (or a hash of it) with their private key, creating a signature. Person B decrypts the signature with A’s public key; successful decryption confirms A as the sender, as only A possesses the private key. This provides non-repudiation, preventing A from denying sending the message. However, since anyone with A’s public key can decrypt the signature, it does not ensure confidentiality. To achieve both security and authenticity, double encryption is used: A encrypts the message with B’s public key (for confidentiality) and then signs it with A’s private key (for authenticity). B verifies the signature with A’s public key and decrypts the message with their private key.

### Why Use JWT?

JWTs provide a stateless, scalable solution for authentication, analogous to a monthly coffee shop pass. Consider a scenario where a customer, Naveen, pays $20 for a month-long coffee subscription at a café. Initially, the café tracks his subscription in a local book with an ID (e.g., 102). However, this approach fails if Naveen visits another branch, as the book is not shared across locations. A better solution is issuing a signed pass stating, “Naveen paid $20 for coffee from [start date] to [end date].” This pass is valid at any branch, eliminating the need for a centralized book. Similarly, in web applications, traditional session-based authentication stores session IDs on the server, requiring shared databases or sticky sessions for scalability across multiple servers. JWTs act like the coffee pass: after login, the server issues a signed token containing user details and expiration, which the client includes in requests. The server verifies the token without needing server-side storage, enabling horizontal scaling. To prevent forgery (e.g., a fake pass), JWTs are signed, ensuring authenticity.

---

### JWT Structure and Encoding

A JWT comprises three Base64-encoded sections separated by dots: Header.Payload.Signature. The Header specifies the token type (JWT) and signing algorithm (e.g., HS256). The Payload contains claims, such as the subject (sub, typically the username), issuance time (iat), and expiration time (exp). The Signature is generated by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret key, ensuring the token’s integrity. While JSON or XML could be used, they are verbose; JWTs use Base64 encoding for compactness, making them suitable for HTTP headers. The payload is not encrypted, only encoded, so sensitive data (e.g., passwords) should not be included unless encrypted separately. Tools like jwt.io allow decoding and inspecting JWTs, revealing the header, payload, and signature details.

### Implementing JWT in a Spring Boot Application

To implement JWT in a Spring Boot application, such as a student management system, several steps are required. The project builds on a Spring Security setup with a stateless configuration, using a database for user storage. Key components include a UserController for registration and login, a JwtService for token generation and validation, and a JwtFilter to verify tokens in requests. The application uses the jjwt library (jjwt-api, jjwt-impl, jjwt-jackson) for JWT operations. Below is a detailed breakdown of the implementation.

#### Project Setup

The application modifies an existing Spring Boot project with Spring Security, using a PostgreSQL database and Hibernate for ORM. The pom.xml is updated to include JWT dependencies. The security configuration disables CSRF and sets the session to stateless, ensuring JWT-based authentication. Public endpoints like /register and /login are permitted without authentication, while others require a valid token.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
        <artifactId>jjwt-api</artifactId>
        <version>0.11.5</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
        <artifactId>jjwt-impl</artifactId>
        <version>0.11.5</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
        <artifactId>jjwt-jackson</artifactId>
        <version>0.11.5</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Custom Login

The UserController handles user registration and login. The /login endpoint accepts a username and password, verifies them using Spring Security’s AuthenticationManager, and generates a JWT if valid. The AuthenticationManager is configured as a bean to authenticate credentials against the database via a DaoAuthenticationProvider. If authentication succeeds, the JwtService generates a token; otherwise, a failure message is returned.

```java
package com.example.controller;

import com.example.model.User;
import com.example.service.JwtService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    @Autowired
    private JwtService jwtService;

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public String login(@RequestBody User user) {
        Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(
                new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(user.getUsername(), user.getPassword())
        );
        if (authentication.isAuthenticated()) {
            return jwtService.generateToken(user.getUsername());
        } else {
            return "Login failed";
        }
    }
}
```

#### Generating JWT

The JwtService generates JWTs using the jjwt library. The generateToken method creates a token with claims (e.g., subject, issuance, expiration), signs it with a secret key using the HS256 algorithm, and returns the compact token. The secret key is either hardcoded or generated dynamically to avoid hardcoding. The token expires after a set period (e.g., 3 minutes).

```java
package com.example.service;

import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
import io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureAlgorithm;
import io.jsonwebtoken.security.Keys;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Service
public class JwtService {

    private String secretKey = "your-base64-encoded-secret-key"; // Replace with secure key

    public String generateToken(String username) {
        Map<String, Object> claims = new HashMap<>();
        return Jwts.builder()
                .setClaims(claims)
                .setSubject(username)
                .setIssuedAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()))
                .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000 * 60 * 3)) // 3 minutes
                .signWith(getKey(), SignatureAlgorithm.HS256)
                .compact();
    }

    private SecretKey getKey() {
        byte[] keyBytes = java.util.Base64.getDecoder().decode(secretKey);
        return Keys.hmacShaKeyFor(keyBytes);
    }
}
```

#### Creating JWT Filter

A custom JwtFilter intercepts requests to validate JWTs before Spring Security’s UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter. The filter extracts the Authorization header, checks for a Bearer token, and validates it using JwtService. If valid, it creates a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken and sets it in the SecurityContextHolder, allowing Spring Security to proceed. The filter extends OncePerRequestFilter to process each request once.

```java
package com.example.config;

import com.example.service.JwtService;
import com.example.service.MyUserDetailsService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken;
import org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextHolder;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
import org.springframework.security.web.authentication.WebAuthenticationDetailsSource;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.filter.OncePerRequestFilter;

import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

@Component
public class JwtFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

    @Autowired
    private JwtService jwtService;

    @Autowired
    private ApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");
        String token = null;
        String username = null;

        if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
            token = authHeader.substring(7);
            username = jwtService.extractUsername(token);
        }

        if (username != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {
            UserDetails userDetails = context.getBean(MyUserDetailsService.class).loadUserByUsername(username);
            if (jwtService.validateToken(token, userDetails)) {
                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
                        userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
                authToken.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));
                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
            }
        }
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
```

#### Validating JWT

The JwtService also validates tokens by extracting claims (e.g., username, expiration) and verifying the signature. The extractUsername method retrieves the subject, while validateToken checks if the username matches the database and if the token is not expired. The extractAllClaims method parses the token using the secret key.

```java
package com.example.service;

import io.jsonwebtoken.Claims;
import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.Date;
import java.util.function.Function;

@Service
public class JwtService {

    private String secretKey = "your-base64-encoded-secret-key"; // Replace with secure key

    public String extractUsername(String token) {
        return extractClaim(token, Claims::getSubject);
    }

    public <T> T extractClaim(String token, Function<Claims, T> claimsResolver) {
        final Claims claims = extractAllClaims(token);
        return claimsResolver.apply(claims);
    }

    private Claims extractAllClaims(String token) {
        return Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(secretKey).parseClaimsJws(token).getBody();
    }

    public boolean validateToken(String token, UserDetails userDetails) {
        final String username = extractUsername(token);
        return (username.equals(userDetails.getUsername()) && !isTokenExpired(token));
    }

    private boolean isTokenExpired(String token) {
        return extractClaim(token, Claims::getExpiration).before(new Date());
    }
}
```

#### Security Configuration

The security configuration integrates the JwtFilter and permits public endpoints. It ensures stateless sessions and disables CSRF, aligning with JWT’s stateless nature.

```java
package com.example.config;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.configuration.AuthenticationConfiguration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.http.SessionCreationPolicy;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Autowired
    private JwtFilter jwtFilter;

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/register", "/login").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
        http.addFilterBefore(jwtFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
        return http.build();
    }

    @Bean
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(AuthenticationConfiguration config) throws Exception {
        return config.getAuthenticationManager();
    }
}
```

### Implementing OAuth2

OAuth2 (Open Authorization) enables third-party login options (e.g., Google, GitHub) in web applications, enhancing user convenience and security. Instead of managing usernames and passwords, applications delegate authentication to providers like Google, which verify user identity and issue access tokens or ID tokens (often JWTs). This eliminates the need for a local database and simplifies login flows. OAuth2 involves a resource owner (user), a client (application), and an authorization server (e.g., Google). The client redirects the user to the provider’s login page, where they authenticate and consent to share specific data (e.g., email, contacts). The provider returns a token, which the client uses to access protected resources.

#### Project Setup for OAuth2

A Spring Boot project is created using Spring Initializer with dependencies for Spring Web and OAuth2 Client. The application includes a simple HelloController returning “Welcome to the Disco” at /hello. The server runs on port 8000, configured in application.properties.

```java
package com.telescope.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String greet() {
        return "Welcome to the Disco";
    }
}
```

#### Google OAuth2 Login

To enable Google login, the application uses Spring Security’s OAuth2 client. A Google Cloud Console project is created to obtain a client ID and secret via the OAuth consent screen. The redirect URI is set to http://localhost:8000/login/oauth2/code/google. These credentials are added to application.properties. The security configuration authorizes all requests and enables OAuth2 login, disabling the default form login.


server.port=8000
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=your-google-client-id
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=your-google-client-secret


```java
package com.telescope.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth.anyRequest().authenticated())
                .oauth2Login().defaultSuccessUrl("/hello");
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

#### GitHub OAuth2 Login

GitHub login is configured similarly. A GitHub OAuth app is registered, providing a client ID and secret, with the callback URL set to http://localhost:8000/login/oauth2/code/github. These credentials are added to application.properties. The existing security configuration supports multiple providers, displaying both Google and GitHub login options.


server.port=8000
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=your-google-client-id
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=your-google-client-secret
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=your-github-client-id
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret=your-github-client-secret

### JWT and OAuth2 Summary

JWT and OAuth2 provide robust authentication solutions. JWTs enable stateless, scalable authentication by issuing signed tokens that clients include in requests, verified by a custom JwtFilter in Spring Boot. OAuth2 enhances user experience by delegating authentication to providers like Google and GitHub, using tokens to access resources securely. The Spring Boot implementation involves configuring security, generating and validating tokens, and integrating third-party logins. Key artifacts include controllers, services, filters, and configuration files, tested via Postman or browser requests. This setup ensures secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication for modern web applications.

---

**Instructions**:  
- Replace placeholder values (e.g., `your-base64-encoded-secret-key`, `your-google-client-id`) with actual credentials.  
- Test JWT endpoints using Postman with Bearer tokens.  
- Access OAuth2-protected endpoints via a browser to verify Google and GitHub login flows.  
- Ensure the application runs on the specified port (e.g., 8000 for OAuth2, 8081 for JWT).  
- Artifacts are provided as standalone files; integrate them into your Spring Boot project as needed.
